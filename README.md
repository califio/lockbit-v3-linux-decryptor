# LOCKIT V3 LINUX DECRYPTOR

This tool decrypts LOCKBIT v3 encrypted files with provided RSA key. For the details on how LOCKBIT V3 works, we have also published an article about it [here](TODO).
  
## BUILD

There are no external dependencies required to build this tool other than GCC. The ***FILE_OFFSET_BITS*** flag is added for the code to handle large file.

```
gcc -o frank frank.c -m32 -z execstack -z execstack -fno-stack-protector -pie -no-pie -Wl,-z,norelro -static -O0 -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
```

or

```
make
```

The tested build environment is **amd64 Ubuntu 22.04**. A prebuilt binary is also included.

## USAGE

```
frank -i <InputFile> -r <RSAKeyFile> [OPTIONS]
      -i: Encrypted file.
      -r: RSA private key file used with -d. Note: Must be exactly 256 bytes long, with RAW RSA d (128 bytes) & n (128 bytes).
      -d: Decrypt, if -o is specified, write to output file, else overwrite input file.
      -o: Output file, used in -d. Note: Overwrite input file is significantly faster.
      -c: Calculate checksum, not decrypt, do not use with -d."
      -v: Verbose.
```

**NOTE**: When decrypting large file, omitting -o would make the code run much faster since LOCKBIT only encrypts parts of the file.
